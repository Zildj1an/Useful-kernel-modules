# Useful-kernel-modules
I will use this repository to keep an index of some kernel modules I have made and found useful.
* [FIFO Character device driver](https://github.com/Zildj1an/FIFO-Driver)
  Notes: Works on Android kernel.
* [Kernel Number Generator](https://github.com/Zildj1an/Kernel-Numbers-Generator)
  Notes: Uses kernel interruptions, semaphores and kernel workqueues.
* [Send signal to process via PID](https://github.com/Zildj1an/Useful-kernel-modules/blob/master/send_signals.c)
